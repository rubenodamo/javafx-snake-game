# MVC Implementation Plan for Snake Game

## Model

### 1. **Identify Components:**
- Represent the game state, logic, and data structures.
- Manage the snake, food, and game rules (collisions and consumption).

### 2. **Refactor Existing Code:**
- Identify existing components that align with MVC roles.
- Extract and refactor code into separate model classes.
- Ensure minimal coupling between components.

### 3. **Model Implementation:**
- Create classes representing the game state, such as `Game`, `Snake`, and `Food`.
- Implement game logic within the model, including movement, collisions, and scoring.

## View

### 1. **Identify Components:**
- Handle the graphical user interface.
- Display the game screen, score, and relevant information.

### 2. **Refactor Existing Code:**
- Identify existing components that align with MVC roles.
- Extract and refactor code into separate view classes (i.e. `GameView`, `MenuView`).
- Utilise JavaFX or Java Swing GUI framework for graphical rendering.

### 3. **View Implementation:**
- Develop classes responsible for rendering the game screen and UI elements.
- Ensure the view updates based on changes in the model.

## Controller

### 1. **Identify Components:**
- Capture user input from the keyboard (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`).
- Translate input into commands for the model.

### 2. **Refactor Existing Code:**
- Identify existing components that align with MVC roles.
- Extract and refactor code into a separate controller class (i.e. `SnakeController`).
- Implement a controller class to handle user input.

### 3. **Controller Implementation:**
- Capture keyboard events and translate them into commands for the model (`UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `P`).
- Update the model based on user input.

### 4. **Connect Components:**
- Establish communication channels between the model, view, and controller.
- Use observers or events to notify the view of changes in the model.
- Ensure the controller interacts with the model and updates the view accordingly.

## Benefits of MVC Implementation

- **Modularity:** Separation of concerns leads to more modular and maintainable code.
- **Scalability:** Easier to extend or modify individual components without affecting the entire system.
- **Testability:** Each component can be tested independently, facilitating unit testing.

## Considerations

- **Tooling:** Ensure that the chosen GUI framework supports the MVC pattern effectively.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in coding standards and adherence to the MVC pattern across the project.

By implementing the MVC pattern, the Snake Game project can achieve improved code organisation, maintainability, and extensibility.
