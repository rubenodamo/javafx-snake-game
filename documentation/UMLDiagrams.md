# Snake Game UML Diagrams

## 1. Initial Class Diagram (Before Code Refactoring)

### Overview:
The initial class diagram was created to capture the structure of the Snake Game project before any significant code refactoring took place. It depicted the initial relationships between classes and their attributes.

### Observations:
- The class relationships were somewhat cluttered, with certain classes having multiple connections.
- Limited clarity on the roles and responsibilities of each class.
- Multiple unused classes mentioned in the note section.

## 2. Generated Class Diagram (IntelliJ)

### Overview:
The generated class diagram was automatically generated by IntelliJ, providing a visual representation of the project's structure based on the existing codebase.

### Observations:
- Improved organization compared to the initial class diagram however still has classes with multiple connections.
- Classes and their relationships were clearer, thanks to IntelliJ's visualisation. 
- **Note:** The composition arrow in IntelliJ points in the opposite direction compared to traditional UML standards. This inversion in the composition arrow direction does not impact the relationship semantics but might be confusing for those familiar with standard UML conventions.

## 3. Updated Class Diagram Post Initial Maintenance

### Overview:
The updated class diagram reflects the changes made during the initial maintenance phase. This includes code refactoring, addressing code smells, and enhancing code readability.

### Changes:
- Refactored (renamed) classes for improved clarity.
- Simplified class relationships and dependencies.
- Introduced new classes to support additional functionalities.

## 4. Comparison Between Initial and Updated Class Diagrams

### Changes:
- **Code Clarity:** The updated class diagram exhibits improved code clarity and organisation.
- **Simplified Relationships:** Redundant relationships were removed, leading to a cleaner structure.
- **New Functionalities:** Introduction of new classes to support additional features.


## 5. Use Case Diagram (Before Code Refactoring)

### Overview:
The use case diagram was created to illustrate the various interactions and functionalities of the Snake Game system before any code refactoring.

### Key Components:
- Actors: Player.
- Use Cases: Play Game, Collision Points, Game Over.

## 6. Use Case Diagram (Extended with Milestone 2 Plans)

### Overview:
The extended use case diagram includes additional use cases and extension points, outlining plans for system enhancements in Milestone 2.

### Extension Points:
- **Customisation Options:** Extension point for allowing players to customise game elements.
- **Settings Support:** Extension point for muting the music.
- **Leaderboard View:** Extension point for incorporating a leaderboard view with unique names.

## 7. Example Menu Wireframe

### Overview:
Example extension point of a main menu, to allow for ease of navigation to various aspects of the game. Includes all the extension points mentioned in the extended use case diagram.

### Features:
- **Navigation Buttons:** Includes "New Game" and "View Leaderboard" buttons.
- **Customise Game Buttons:** Includes buttons which allow the user to customise the game. For example the paint brush to change the background and the volume button to mute the music.

## 8. High Level Class Diagram

### Overview: 
Final class diagram illustrating the relationships among classes within the MVC architecture. 

### Key Points:
- Usage dependencies are intentionally omitted for simplicity. 
- It's crucial to highlight that the multiplicity of the EnemyModel class is specified as 1, but the logical multiplicity is 0..1. 
  - This distinction arises from the fact that the existence of the enemy depends on a flag set in the MenuView class; it may or may not exist based on this condition.

## 9. Final Use Case Diagram

### Overview:
The following is a use case diagram portraying the final game system. 

### Extension Points:
- Extension points have been incorporated into the "New Game" use case to accommodate the multiplayer functionality. 
- Additionally, an "Enemy" actor is introduced to symbolise the actions undertaken by the second user in the game.

## Conclusion:

The UML diagrams provided valuable insights into the evolution of the Snake Game project. The initial class diagram highlighted areas for improvement, while the generated class diagram offered a clearer visualisation. The post-maintenance class diagram demonstrates the positive impact of code refactoring, and the use case diagrams outline both existing functionalities and future plans for system enhancements. These diagrams collectively serve as crucial documentation for understanding the project's structure, evolution, and future development paths (sections 9 and 10).
